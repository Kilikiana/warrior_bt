## CRITICAL: Stop Making Assumptions

**NEVER make assumptions or guess about:**
- Data values, calculations, or results
- Why code is behaving in a certain way  
- What error messages mean without investigating
- Pattern detection logic without reading the actual code
- Mathematical calculations without verifying the numbers

**ALWAYS:**
- Read actual data/code to understand what's happening
- State only verifiable facts
- When unsure, say "I need to investigate this" instead of guessing
- Debug systematically with actual evidence
- Ask for clarification when uncertain

## Recent Example of Bad Behavior:
❌ **Wrong**: "LGHL failed because pullback was too deep (>50% retrace)"
- Made assumption without checking actual data
- LGHL only pulled back 3.6% ($2.47 → $2.38)
- Completely fabricated explanation

✅ **Correct**: "The system reports 'retrace_too_deep' but I need to investigate why since the actual pullback was only 3.6%"

## Key Principle:
**Facts over assumptions. Evidence over guesses. Investigation over speculation.**
