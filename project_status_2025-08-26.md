# Project Status & Strategy Optimization Notes

**Date:** 2025-08-26

## Objective

The primary goal of this session was to analyze, debug, and optimize the `bull_flag_simple_v3.py` trading strategy to achieve profitability on the sample dataset for `2025-07-01`.

## Process Summary

We followed an iterative, scientific approach to identify issues and improve performance. The key steps were:

1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** The first test runs showed the strategy was taking **zero trades**. The log analysis revealed that the entry filters (specifically `spread_cap_bps` and `breakout_vol_mult`) were too strict for the volatile stocks being tested.
2.  **Filter Relaxation:** We relaxed the filters to allow trades to be executed, which resulted in a net loss but provided crucial data on strategy performance.
3.  **Stop-Loss Tuning:** We hypothesized that the initial stop-loss was too tight. We tested a wider, buffered stop-loss. This change **worsened performance**, indicating the issue was not the stop placement but the quality of the entry signal.
4.  **Entry Confirmation:** We changed the entry trigger from entering on a *touch* of the breakout level to waiting for a 1-minute candle to **close** above it. This provided stronger confirmation and was a major turning point, significantly reducing losses.
5.  **Volume Filter Tuning:** We re-evaluated the volume filter, finding that a multiplier of `1.0` was better than a stricter `1.5` for this dataset.
6.  **Exit Logic Optimization:** The final and most impactful change was to the profit-taking logic. We changed the strategy from selling 50% at the first target to **selling 100%**. This locked in wins and prevented them from turning into break-even trades or small losses.

### Backtest Results Progression

| Metric    | Run 1 (Initial) | Run 2 (Wider Stop) | Run 3 (Close Confirm) | Run 4 (Strict Vol) | **Run 5 (Sell 100%)** |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **P&L**   | **$-2,120**     | **$-3,378**       | **$-1,393**           | **$-2,361**       | **$+134**                   |
| Entries   | 28              | 27                 | 22                    | 19                 | **23**                      |
| Hit Rate  | 39.3%           | 33.3%              | 40.9%                 | 31.6%              | **43.5%**                   |

## Current Status

- The `bull_flag_simple_v3` strategy is now **profitable** on the `2025-07-01` test data.
- The backtesting script `warrior_backtest_main.py` has been optimized with in-memory caching to significantly speed up test runs.
- The strategy code has been refactored to remove redundant logic.

### Next Steps

- **Validate:** Run the current, optimized strategy across a wider range of dates to ensure its performance is robust.
- **Enhance:** Revisit the concept of runner management to see if more advanced trailing stop techniques can capture larger wins without significantly hurting the new, profitable baseline.
